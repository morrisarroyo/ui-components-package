# AutoPhase log

Baseline before this run: 0 tests (none written), no commits — Phase 0 committed as `cecc901` at the start of the run; Phase 1 components drafted but uncommitted and untested.

Run of 2026-09-25, Phase 1, full auto (commits unreviewed). One entry per task, written as it lands.

## T-1.1 Design tokens
- **Verified:** scripted check of all 24 token-sheet rows in `docs/DESIGNDOCUMENT.md` against `packages/ui/src/tokens.css` — each property defined exactly once with the stated value (hex differs only in case); the 15 typography properties read by hand.
- **Note:** committed with a tokens-only `src/index.ts`; each component task adds its own export lines so every commit builds.
