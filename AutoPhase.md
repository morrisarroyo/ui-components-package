# AutoPhase log

Baseline before this run: 0 tests (none written), no commits — Phase 0 committed as `cecc901` at the start of the run; Phase 1 components drafted but uncommitted and untested.

Run of 2026-09-25, Phase 1, full auto (commits unreviewed). One entry per task, written as it lands.

## T-1.1 Design tokens
- **Verified:** scripted check of all 24 token-sheet rows in `docs/DESIGNDOCUMENT.md` against `packages/ui/src/tokens.css` — each property defined exactly once with the stated value (hex differs only in case); the 15 typography properties read by hand.
- **Note:** committed with a tokens-only `src/index.ts`; each component task adds its own export lines so every commit builds.

## Toolchain fix (T-0.3 / T-0.4 defect, found during T-1.2)
- **What:** `tsc` had never passed. Added `packages/ui/src/vite-env.d.ts` (CSS Module types), relative lib entry in place of `resolve(__dirname, …)`, `defineConfig` from `vitest/config` in both packages, Vitest ^2.1.8 → ^3.2.4 (Vitest 2 nested its own Vite 5 against the project's Vite 6).
- **Verified:** `npx tsc --noEmit` clean in `ui` and `app`; `vite build && tsc -p tsconfig.build.json` emits `ui.js`, `ui.css`, `index.d.ts`; the 36 drafted component tests still pass on Vitest 3.
- **Plan discrepancy:** T-0.3 was marked Done on "config files are internally consistent", a check that never ran the compiler. Committed as a separate fix rather than folded into a component task so it can be reverted on its own.
